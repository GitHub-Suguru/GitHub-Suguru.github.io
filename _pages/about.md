I was born and raised in Gunma Prefecture, a countryside region of Japan surrounded by mountains and open landscapes. Growing up, I was more inclined toward physical activity than academics, spending much of my time in competitive motorsports and swimming. At that stage, my interests were driven more by motion, speed, and coordination than by equations or theory.

During high school, my perspective began to shift. I encountered the manga Space Brothers, which introduced me to the human side of space exploration—the perseverance, teamwork, and long-term dedication required to pursue ambitious goals such as becoming an astronaut. Around the same time, I was given the opportunity to visit NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where I listened to engineers and astronauts describe their work and entered the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). Standing inside the VAB and witnessing the sheer scale of the structure left a lasting impression. I was astonished that human beings could design, assemble, and launch such massive systems into space with precision and reliability. That experience solidified my decision to study aerospace engineering and ultimately pursue my education in the United States.

After enrolling at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), my interests gradually shifted toward unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs represented a relatively young and rapidly evolving area of aerospace engineering, where theoretical advances could be directly tested through simulation and experimentation. I became particularly interested in how multiple autonomous agents can coordinate, synchronize, and operate safely in shared environments—problems that lie at the intersection of dynamics, control, and decision-making.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington, working under the guidance of Dr. Kamesh Subbarao in the Aerospace Systems Laboratory. My research focuses on physics-informed and machine-learning-based UAV formation control, with particular emphasis on synchronization, collision avoidance, machine learning, computer vision, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). More broadly, I am interested in problems that lie at the intersection of control theory, robotics, and state estimation, where theoretical guarantees must be reconciled with practical implementation constraints. I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Aerospace Engineering from UTA in 2022 and 2023, respectively, and my current work aims to bridge analytical modeling, optimization-based control, and real-world autonomous system deployment.
