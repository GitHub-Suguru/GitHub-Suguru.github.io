Served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate Flight Dynamics course, supporting instruction on aircraft equations of motion, trim analysis, linearization about equilibrium flight conditions, and stability and dynamic response analysis. Responsibilities included holding weekly office hours to assist students with homework and exam preparation, providing guidance on MATLAB-based simulations of aircraft motion, and reinforcing key concepts such as state-space modeling, transfer functions, and stability augmentation. Assisted the instructor with grading assignments and exams, clarifying theoretical and computational aspects of flight dynamics, and helping students develop physical intuition for aircraft stability, transient response, and control-relevant dynamics.
