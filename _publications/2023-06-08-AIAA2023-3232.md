## Abstract
The development of high-speed aerospace vehicles can benefit from carrying out benchmark studies, which involve the conceptual design of the simplest and smallest vehicles able to complete high-speed flight missions. The Summer 2022 undergraduate Aerospace Engineering capstone project at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) focused on replicating Charles Lindbergh’s famous 1927 transatlantic flight aboard the Spirit of St. Louis at supersonic (Mach 2, 3, 4) and hypersonic (Mach 5, 6, 7) cruising speeds, with two teams using advanced aircraft conceptual design methodologies. This paper is the result of revisiting the parametric sizing portion of the capstone project using a unified methodology. Six solution space carpet plots containing converged vehicles were produced using a sizing process based on Hypersonic Convergence. One solution space was generated for each design mission, and design point vehicles were selected from the solution spaces. Key design parameters were defined, their values were obtained using verified methodologies, and those values were plotted across the Mach number range to search for correlations between these parameters and cruising Mach number. From Mach 2 to 5, the selected design vehicles increased in size as Mach number increased, and from Mach 5 to 7, they decreased in size as Mach number increased. It was necessary to increase the wing loading limit by increasing approach CL,max beyond Mach 4 to enable design point vehicle selection based on the selection process criteria. Key parameter correlation plots can help future aircraft designers derive reasonable starting point estimates. While the correlations are specific to the mission requirement assigned in the capstone project, they could potentially be applied to other missions using scaling factors pending further examination.

## Contribution
This paper presents a unified benchmark study of transatlantic supersonic and hypersonic cruise aircraft inspired by Charles Lindbergh’s 1927 Spirit of St. Louis mission. Using a consistent parametric sizing methodology based on Hypersonic Convergence, solution spaces and design point vehicles are generated for Mach 2 through Mach 7 cruise conditions. The study reveals non-monotonic scaling trends in vehicle weight, size, and volume, identifies Mach 5 as a critical design inflection point, and quantifies fuel-fraction growth and wing-loading feasibility limits across the Mach range. The resulting correlations provide transferable early-stage design guidance for future high-speed aircraft concepts.
