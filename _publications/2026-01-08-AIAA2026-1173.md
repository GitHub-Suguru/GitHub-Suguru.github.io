## Abstract
This paper presents a three-dimensional, hydrodynamics-inspired collision avoidance framework for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) formations operating in dynamic environments. When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications. 

## Contribution
This paper introduces a physics-inspired, three-dimensional hydrodynamic flow-based collision avoidance framework for UAVs and UAV formations operating in dynamic environments, where emergent moving obstacles are modeled as 3D doublets or ellipsoids that induce smooth, continuous velocity fields for real-time avoidance without explicit trajectory replanning or future-state prediction. A key contribution is the integration of this flow-based avoidance mechanism with a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation framework, enabling multi-UAV systems to preserve formation geometry, rigidity, and coordinated trajectory tracking while executing avoidance maneuvers. The approach leverages the harmonic properties of Laplace’s equation to avoid local minima and oscillatory behavior common in traditional potential-field methods, while remaining computationally lightweight and interpretable. Extensive 3D simulations demonstrate scalable, collision-free performance for both single UAVs and multi-agent formations under moving obstacles and noisy sensor measurements, highlighting the method’s suitability for real-time autonomy and practical deployment.
