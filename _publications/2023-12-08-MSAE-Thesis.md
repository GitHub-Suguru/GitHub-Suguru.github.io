title: "A Rigid Body Framework For Modeling and Simulation of Formation of Autonomous Agents"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-MSAE-Thesis
excerpt: 'This thesis develops a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) framework that models a formation of autonomous agents as nodes of a rigid body, enabling collision-free formation establishment, maintenance, reconfiguration, and station-keeping through constraint forces and 6-DOF dynamics. The framework integrates rigorous mathematical modeling, control law design (including LQR), and extensive simulations to demonstrate scalable and robust formation control for multi-agent systems'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
