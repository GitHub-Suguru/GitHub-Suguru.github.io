## Abstract
This paper presents thorough mathematical modeling, control law development, and simulation of virtual structure formations which are inspired by the characteristics of rigid bodies. The stable constraint forces that establish the rigidity in the formation are synthesized by utilizing d'Alembert's principle of virtual work, constraint sensitivities (Lagrange multipliers) and constraint stabilization using Baumgarte stabilization. The governing equations of motion of a multiagent system are derived via Newton's and Euler's equations to include these constraint forces and to enable inputs regarding the formation as if it were an independent rigid body. The performance of this framework is evaluated under multiple cases including waypoint following missions, and using different number of agents.

## Contribution
This paper presents a rigorous constraint-based Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) framework for multi-UAV formation flight. A physically consistent constraint force formulation is derived using d’Alembert’s principle, Lagrange multipliers, and Baumgarte stabilization to enforce inter-agent rigidity. Unified 6-DOF equations of motion are developed for an arbitrary number of agents, enabling direct control of formation-level translational and rotational dynamics using quaternion-based attitude representation. An input decoupling method is introduced to map formation-level commands to individual agent inputs. The framework is validated through extensive simulations demonstrating formation establishment, reconfiguration, orientation control, and station-keeping for formations ranging from three to eight agents in single- and multi-waypoint scenarios.
