## Summary
This project presents an accurate, **cost-effective, and easy-to-implement indoor motion capture system** designed for uncrewed vehicle systems (UVS), with particular emphasis on micro aerial vehicles and small ground robots. The system leverages off-the-shelf hardware, multi-camera triangulation, and optimal estimation techniques to provide reliable 3D position tracking without reliance on expensive commercial motion capture infrastructure. By combining kinematics-based triangulation with weighted least squares (WLS) fusion and Kalman filtering, the framework achieves millimeter- to centimeter-level accuracy suitable for control, estimation, and autonomy research in GPS-denied environments.
